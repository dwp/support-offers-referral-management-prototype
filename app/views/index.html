        <p class="govuk-body">
          Support Offers will take a person-centred approach: develop knowledge of a person’s circumstances to determine
          their needs and recommend actions tailored to their needs. Recommendations for individuals will reflect their
          complexity as a person; Support Offers will treat the whole person, not just the symptom of worklessness, to
          meet DWP objectives of quality of life and financial resilience in a balanced way.
